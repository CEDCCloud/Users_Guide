<title>Overview of the Cloud Area Padovana</title>
<para>                                                                          
The <literal>Cloud Area Padovana</literal> is an OpenStack based cloud.         
</para>

<para>
It implements a IaaS (Infrastructure as a service):
it allows the instantiations of Virtual Machines (VMs) of the desired
environments (in terms of operating system, installed software, etc.)
and of the desired flavors (in terms of processors, memory size, etc.).
</para>


<para>                                                                          
Even if it is a single, logical Cloud service, its resources are spread in two  
different locations: INFN Padova and INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro (LNL). 

</para>

The Cloud Area Padovana is currently based on the Havana version of the    
OpenStack middleware.

<title>Projects</title>
<para>
<literal>Projects</literal> (also known as tenants)                             
are organizational units in the cloud. A project is used to map or isolate users 
and their resources. </para>

<para>                                                                             
Projects are given quotas on resource usage, in terms of virtual machines, cores,  
memory, storage, etc.                                                              
</para>

<para>                                                                             
A project can have a single user as member (personal project) but the typical use  
case are shared projects, with multiple users as members, which can map to experiments,                                                                              
organizations, research groups, etc.                                               
A user can be on multiple projects at the same time and switch between them.       
</para>

In the Cloud Area Padovana projects usually map to experiments or other research 
groups                                                                              
who "own" resources in the cloud service.                                          
Each project has a manager (usually the team leader), who is responsible to manage
(accepting or refusing) membership requests for the project.                       
</para>

<para>                                                                             
A special shared project, called <literal>guest</literal> is used for all other    
users: it has a small quota to allow testing the Cloud infrastructure.             
</para>

<warning><para>                                                                
<literal>Personal private</literal> projects are instead discouraged and are created only for 
convincing  reasons.

<para>                                                                         
Virtual Machines created in the Cloud Area Padovana are by
default “visible” from the Local Area Networks (LANs) of both Padova and 
LNL. This means that e.g. users can access via ssh VMs of the Cloud directly 
from their desktops located in Padova or Legnaro. 

It is then possible to control which services/ports can be accessed
using the security groups (discussed later) and firewalls
on the relevant VMs.
</para>

<para>
If it is necessary to log on a VM of the Cloud from the Internet, it is 
necessary to go through a gate machine. For this purpose users can rely
on the existing gate hosts in Padova and Legnaro. 
Users who don't have an account on such gate hosts can rely on 
a Cloud specific gate host (<literal>cld-gate.pd.infn.it</literal>): please contact 
<email>cloud-support@lists.pd.infn.it</email> if you need an account on such 
machine.
</para>

<para>
If needed, e.g. if a VM should host a service accessible from the 
Internet, such VM on the Cloud can be given a public IP.
If this is the case please contact 
<email>cloud-support@lists.pd.infn.it</email>. 
</para>


<para>
From a VM of the Cloud, it is possible to access the outside 
Internet network, while by default
it is not possible to      
access a host/service hosted in Padova or Legnaro. 
If, for some reasons, you need to access some
services hosted in Padova or Legnaro from the Cloud, please contact
<email>cloud-support@lists.pd.infn.it</email>.
