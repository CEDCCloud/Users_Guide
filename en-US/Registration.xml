To be able to use the CloudVeneto service, first of all you need to        
apply for an account.                                                              
The procedure to be followed is described in this chapter.

Once authenticated on your SSO system you will be redirected on the cloud we site and 
a form like the one in the following picture should appear:

</para>

<para>
Fill the form with the name of your organization (e.g. 'INFN Padova'),
your phone number, the name of a contact person in Padova/Legnaro
(e.g. your team leader), and if needed some notes.
</para>


<para>
For what concerns the <menuchoice><guimenu>Project Action</guimenu></menuchoice>
(projects have been discussed in <xref linkend="Projects"/>) you 
have two options:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Select Existing Projects</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Create new project</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
Choose <literal>Select Existing Projects</literal> if you want to apply
membership for one or more existing projects (choose them in the relevant
box).
</para>

<para>
Select <literal>Create new project</literal> if instead you want to ask
the creation of a new project. In this case you will have to specify also
a Project name and a Project Description. You will also have to specify
if this project must be private (a personal project where you will
be the only member) or not.
</para>

<para>
Newly created projects will get a default quota of:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>20 VCPU</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>40 GB RAM</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>200 GB for Volume (e.g. non ephemeral) storage</para></listitem>

Allocation of more resources must be approved by the Cloud "governance".</para>
<para>Mail your request to <email>cloud-unipd-gov@lists.pd.infn.it</email> 
if you want more resources to be allocated to your project.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Public (i.e. not private) projects are projects where other users can apply
for membership. They are supposed to be used for experiments or other research
groups.
</para>
<para><literal>Personal private</literal> projects are <literal>discouraged</literal> and are created 
only for convincing reasons. </para>
</note>

<note>
<para>
The person who asks for the creation of a new project is automatically
defined as the manager of this project, i.e. he/she will have to
manage the membership requests for this project. So the request to create a new
project should be done by the relevant experiment/group leader.
</para>
</note>

<para>
Requests for new project creation will only be accepted from selected people
from the relevant Departments/Institutions. Please refer to the following table
to contact the appropriate person:
