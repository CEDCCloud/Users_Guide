box).
</para>

<para>
Select <literal>Create new project</literal> if instead you want to ask
the creation of a new project. In this case you will have to specify also
a Project name and a Project Description. You will also have to specify
if this project must be private (a personal project where you will
be the only member) or not.

<para>
The person who asks for the creation of a new project is automatically
defined as the manager of this project, i.e. he/she will have to
