<title>Creating VMs</title>
<para>
To create a VM using the dashboard, you need to have already logged into the 
dashboard and created your private key, as explained before.
</para>

<para>
To create a VM, the steps are as follows:
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Number of virtual CPU cores (VCPUs)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Amount of memory</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Go to <menuchoice><guimenu>Instances</guimenu></menuchoice> on the left hand 
menu. This will display a list of VMs currently running in your project.
</para></listitem>


<listitem><para>
Select <menuchoice><guimenu>Launch Instance</guimenu></menuchoice> on the 
top right hand side of the dashboard. A new menu appears where you can enter:
</para>


<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>
<menuchoice><guimenu>Instance name</guimenu></menuchoice> is the name of the 
machine you want to create. Please note that this name will not be registered 
in the DNS
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
<menuchoice><guimenu>Flavor</guimenu></menuchoice> is the size of the machine 
you want to create. These are specified using VPCU (number of virtual CPUs, 
GB of disk space for the system disk, MB RAM for the memory). Selecting small 
flavors is more economical and the flavor of a virtual machine can be changed 
later if required.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
As <menuchoice><guimenu>Instance Boot Source</guimenu></menuchoice> 
select <menuchoice><guimenu>Boot from Image</guimenu></menuchoice> or

Select the keypair you created. This will allow you to log in as root using 
the key
</para></listitem>


<listitem><para>
You can also specify the admin (usually root) password of the instance. 
Please note that this is not guaranteed to always work (the image can't 
support the “injection” of this password). It is therefore suggested to use 
the ssh-key mechanisms.

Swith the tab for <menuchoice><guimenu>Networking</guimenu></menuchoice>.
You should see one network called <replaceable>xyz-lan</replaceable>, and in 
some cases also another network called <replaceable>xyz-wan</replaceable>. 
Select the former one if your VM doesn't need to be visible on the Internet. 
Select instead the <replaceable>xyz-wan</replaceable> network if your VM must 
have a public IP
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
Select <menuchoice><guimenu>Launch</guimenu></menuchoice> to start the 
virtual machine being created. When this returns to the overview screen, 
there will be a line with the instance name, ip adress and status. The status 
should be active once the install is complete.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>
Once the status of the machine is 'Active', you can watch the console to see 
it installing and booting. On the right hand side of the table, under 
<menuchoice><guimenu>More</guimenu></menuchoice>, there is a pull down menu. 
Options include <menuchoice><guimenu>View Log</guimenu></menuchoice> and 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Console</guimenu></menuchoice>. For a Linux machine, 
select <menuchoice><guimenu>Console</guimenu></menuchoice> to access to the 
console of the VM.
</para>


<warning><para>
Please note that Virtual Machines instantiated on the Cloud aren't
registered in the DNS. This means that you'll have to refer to them
using there IP numbers.
</para></warning>

<note><para>
Please note that this setting the admin password is not guaranteed to always 
work (the image can't support the “injection” of this password). It is 
therefore suggested to use the ssh-key mechanisms.

<section id="AccessingVMs">
<title>Accessing to VMs</title>
<para>
Assuming you created a Linux virtual machine, using the keypair provided on 
the start of the VM creation, you can now log in as root.

Assuming you stored your <replaceable>my_key</replaceable> keypair in 
<replaceable>~/private</replaceable>:
</para>

<screen>
$ ssh -o GSSAPIAuthentication=no -i ~/my_key root@10.62.15.3
</screen>

<para>
<warning><para>
Please note that VMs of the Cloud are not registered in the DNS, and therefore you must use the IP address.
</para></warning>
</para>

</section>


<section id="NetworkCond">
<title>Network considerations</title>
<para>
VMs created using the <replaceable>xyz-lan</replaceable> network are
“visible” from both the LAN of Padova and Legnaro. This means that e.g.
you can access via ssh a VM of the Cloud directly from your desktop located
in Padova or Legnaro. Security groups (discussed below) and firewalls
set on the VM (e.g. through iptables) then determine which services/port can
be accessed.
</para>
<para>
The contrary is instead not possible: from a VM created using the
<replaceable>xyz-lan</replaceable> network it is generally not possible to
access a host/service hosted in Padova or Legnaro LANs. It is instead
possible to access the outside Internet network.
</para>
</section>

<section id="Flavors">
<title>Flavors</title>
<para>
Flavors define the virtual machine size such as:
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Number of virtual CPU cores (VCPUs)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Amount of memory</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Disk space</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
When an instance has to be created, the flavor to be used for this VM must
be chosen. Information about the flavors can be seen in the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Flavor Details</guimenu></menuchoice> box in the
Dashboard.
</para>

<note><para>
For what concerns VCPUs, please note that the Cloud middleware is configured
to allow some “overbooking”. The Cloud Area Padovana is configured so that a
physical core is mapped to 4 VCPUs
</para></note>

<para>
A disk size of 0 means that the size of the disk is the same as that in the
image. For other cases, it may be necessary to resize the partitions.
</para>
<para>
If you find that the specific flavor you require is not available, please
contact <email>cloud-support@lists.pd.infn.it</email>.

<section id="StoppingAndStartingVMs">
<title>Stopping and Starting VMs</title>

<para>
VMs can be stopped and started in different ways, available in the Dashboad 
menu (<menuchoice><guimenu>Instances</guimenu><guisubmenu>More</guisubmenu></menuchoice>).
</para>

<para>
The cleanest way to shutdown (or reboot) an instance is to log on the VM and 
issue from the shell the shutdown/reboot command. In fact if the 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Soft Reboot</guimenu></menuchoice> 
or <menuchoice><guimenu>Hard Reboot</guimenu></menuchoice> or 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Shutdown</guimenu></menuchoice> actions are chosen, 
there could be problems with networking when the VM is later restarted.
</para>

<para>
<menuchoice><guimenu>Pause</guimenu></menuchoice>/<menuchoice><guimenu>Unpause</guimenu></menuchoice> 
allows for temporary suspension of the VM. The VM is kept in 
memory but it is not allocated any CPU time.
</para>

<para>
<menuchoice><guimenu>Suspend</guimenu></menuchoice>/<menuchoice><guimenu>Resume</guimenu></menuchoice> 
stores the VM onto disk and recovers it later. This is faster 
than stop/start and the VM returns to the place is was when the suspend was 
performed rather than a new boot cycle.
</para>

<section id="ResizingVMs">
<title>Resizing VMs</title>

<para>
If the size of a virtual machine needs to be changed, such as adding more 
memory or cores, this can be done using the resize operations. Using resize, 
you can select a new flavor for your virtual machine. The operation will 
reboot the virtual machine and will take several minutes of downtime, so this 
operation should be scheduled as it will lead to application downtime.
</para>

<para>
To resize a VM using the Horizon graphical Interface:
</para>

<para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Select the <menuchoice><guimenu>Instances</guimenu></menuchoice> 
menu and the <menuchoice><guimenu>Resize Instance</guimenu></menuchoice> 
option on the actions</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>After the new flavor has been selected, the status will 
become 'resize' or 'migrating'</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The status will change after several minutes to 'Confirm' or 
'Revert Resize/Migrate'. You may need to refresh the web browser page to 
reflect the new status.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Select <menuchoice><guimenu>Confirm Resize/Migrate</guimenu></menuchoice> 
if you wish to change the instance to the new configuration.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
The status will then change to 'Active' once completed.
</para>

</section>


<section id="SnapshottingVMs">
<title>Snapshotting VMs</title>

<para>
It is possible to create a snapshot of a VM, and then the saved snapshot can 
be used to start new instance(s).
</para>

<para>
The new instance can also have a flavor different (but not smaller for what 
concern the disk size) than the source VM. It is therefore suggested to use 
the smallest (in terms of disk) possible flavor for the source VM (for SL6.x 
related images this is 'm1.xsmall').
</para>

<para>
Before doing a snapshot, it is needed to clean the network configurations of 
the “source” VM. For SL6.x related OS this can be done using the following instructions, once logged as root on the “source” VM:
</para>

<screen>
/bin/rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
/bin/rm /lib/udev/write_net_rules
</screen>

<para>
Before doing the snapshot (that can be done using the web-based dashboard, it 
is recommended to shut down the source VM to make sure that all data is 
flushed to disk. To perform this shutdown of the VM, please don't do it 
through Openstack. Instead please do the shutdown within the VM (i.e. log as root to the VM and issue ”shutdown -h now” or ”poweroff”).
</para>

</section>


<section id="DeletingVMs">
<title>Deleting VMs</title>

<para>
VMs can be deleted using the <menuchoice><guimenu>Terminate Instance</guimenu></menuchoice> 
option in the OpenStack dashboard.
</para>

<warning><para>
Note: This will immediately terminate the instance, delete all content of the 
virtual machine and erase the ephemeral disk. This operation is not 
recoverable.
</para></warning>
