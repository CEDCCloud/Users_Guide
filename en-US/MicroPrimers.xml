<para>
The <literal>CEDC Cloud</literal> provides an infrastructure where your virtual machines can live.
After you have activated your virtual machine(s) you are on your own for the most part of the day to day 
administration tasks.
</para>

<warning><para>
We will only focus on Linux VMs, showing differences between the RedHat (CentOS, Fedora, ... ) and Debian (Ubuntu, Mint, ... ) distributions.
</para>
<para>
Througout this chapter we will address the former with RH and the latter with DEB.
</para>
</warning>

<para>
Some of these tasks might be:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Use your VM as root only when needed;</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Installing/deinstalling software;</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Adding another user to your VM;</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Formatting the volume you just attached to your VM;</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Automatically remount the volume on next reboot.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
In this chapter we provide some very small introductory instructions on performing such tasks.
</para>

<section id="sudo"><title>Setting up 'sudo'</title>
<para>
Nobody (not even administrators) use a Unix/Linux system <literal>always</literal> as root.
</para>
<para>If you do you should stop immediately (no jokes!).</para>
<para>
Normally you have your user with limited privileges and, when needed, you use <literal>su</literal> (which stands for 'switch user') to become root,
perform the privileged task and then you go back to the normal user.
</para>
<para>
A more flexible approach is using <literal>sudo</literal> (Super User DO) to perform the 'one shot' task or to allow certain users to perform only
some tasks as the superuser. The configuration of sudo is performed by modifying the <literal>/etc/sudoers</literal> file or (better) by adding a
file in the <literal>/etc/sudoers.d</literal> directory.
</para>
<para>
Follow these instructions to allow the user <literal>paolo</literal> (change this to your username) to perform any command as the superuser
providing his own password, or to modify your user privileges (in this case there is already a file with your username in the <literal>/etc/sudoers.d</literal> directory):
<itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para>Become the <literal>root</literal> user:
      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem><para>RH: using <command>su</command> and providing the root password</para></listitem>
         <listitem><para>DEB: using <command>sudo su -</command> and providing your password</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem><para>Create the file <literal>/etc/sudoers.d/paolo</literal> using your preferred editor;</para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>Add this line inside the file:
      <screen>
      paolo            ALL = (ALL) ALL 
      </screen>
      </para>
      <para>If you want the user to do everything without even providing the password put this line instead:
      <screen>
      paolo            ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL
      </screen>
      </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem><para>change the file permissions: <command>chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/paolo</command></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
Now when paolo logs in to the VM he is allowed to perform superuser tasks by prefixing the command with <command>sudo</command>.
</para>
<para>
If you want to limit the user to perform only certain commands (or classes of commands, e.g. installing/deinstalling software) you can look at
the sudo documentation on your VM using <screen>man sudoers</screen>
</para>
</section>
<section id="ManagingSoftware"><title>Managing software through the package manager</title>
<para>
RedHat and Debian based linux distributions both have their software management system. On RH each software is packaged in <literal>rpm</literal>
form (RPM stands for RedHat Package Manager) while DEB uses <literal>deb</literal> packages. 
</para>
