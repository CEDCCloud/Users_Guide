<title>Managing Images</title>
<para>
In a cloud environment, Virtual Machines are instantiated from images. These 
images are registered in an Image Management Service, in our case provided by 
the Glance OpenStack component. 
</para>

<section id="PublicImages">
<title>Public Images</title>
<para>
Some images in the CloudVeneto are provided by the Cloud 
administrators. These images are public, and visible to all users.
They appear in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Public</guimenu></menuchoice> 
tab of the <menuchoice><guimenu>Images &amp; Snapshots</guimenu></menuchoice> 
menu.

</imageobject>
</mediaobject>


</para>

<para>
The <literal>SL6x-x86-64-&lt;date&gt;</literal> is a basic 
SL6.x image which
also includes cloud-init to perform contextualization based on the user data 
specified when the VM are instantiated. It also configures CVMFS and the
relevant squid servers.
</para>

<para>
The <literal>SL6x-x86-64-&lt;date&gt;</literal> image, wrt the
<literal>SL6x-x86-64-&lt;date&gt;</literal> image, also configures the
Padova LDAP server for user authentication. This means that it is just 
necessary to “enable” the relevant accounts on the VM adding in the 
/etc/passwd file:

<screen>
+name1::::::
+name2::::::
...
</screen>
and creating their home directories.
</para>

<para>
Changes done in /etc/passwd could not be applied immediately by the system. 
In this case a:

<screen>
nscd -i passwd
</screen>

should help.
</para>
 

<para>
In the production cloud SL 6.x images are provided in QCOW2 format.
They are fully resizable also with respect to the disk size.
</para>


</section>

<section id="UserProvidedImages">
<title>User Provided Images</title>
<para>
Along with the standard images, users can provide their own images
and upload them to the Cloud Image service:
these images are private, meaning that they are only available to the users 
of the project they are uploaded for.
</para>

<note><para>
Users are not allowed to publish public (i.e. available to all projects) 
images.
This means that you don't have to use the <literal>--public</literal> flag
with the <literal> glance image-create</literal> command, otherwise you will 
get a quite cryptic error message such as:

<screen>
Request returned failure status.
403 Forbidden
Access was denied to this resource.
    (HTTP 403)
</screen>
</para></note>


<para>
Many open source projects such as Ubuntu and Fedora now produce pre-build 
images which can be used for certain clouds. If these are available, it is 
much easier to use these compared to building your own.

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><ulink url="http://cloud.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora repository</ulink></para></listitem> 
<listitem><para><ulink url="http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu repository</ulink></para></listitem> 

</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
Building your own images is also possible, as described in 
<xref linkend="BuildingImages"/>.
</para>

<para>
Taking an example of the Ubuntu image, after having downloaded the
image from the relevant web site, to upload such image 
(using the command line tools) it is necessary first of all to 
authenticate to OpenStack using the openrc source, and then the
following command must be issued:

<screen>
glance image-create --name=ubuntu-trusty --disk-format=qcow2 \
--container-format=bare --property hypervisor_type=qemu \
--file trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img
</screen>

Once loaded, the image can then be used to create virtual machines. 
</para>

<para>
Some system software is delivered in ISO image format. 
For example, these steps show how to create an image from the Freedos ISO 
available at http://www.freedos.org/download/and downloaded to fd11src.iso:

<screen>
glance image-create --name freedos11 --disk-format=iso \
--container-format=bare --file=fd11src.iso
</screen>
</para>


<note><para>
In the production Cloud only images with a maximum size of 25 GB are
allowed.
</para></note>


<warning><para>
No backup is currently done on user provided images and on snapshots.
Therefore users with private images should keep a copy of the images they 
have uploaded in their private archives. 
</para></warning>

<section id="SharingImages">
<title>Sharing Images</title>
<para>
As mentioned before, users are not allowed to publish public images.
However images can be shared between different projects. This is currently only
possible via the command line tools.
</para>

<para>
If an image has been uploaded to your currently active project, using the
procedure described in 
<xref linkend="UserProvidedImages"/>, 
you can then use the <command>glance member-create</command> operations to 
share that image with another project.
</para>

<para>
To share an image, first source the project profile for the 
project containing the image you want to share and find its id with
the <command>glance image-show</command> command
(e0d35322-d509-4202-9b40-7d74e7aca0b6 in the 
example):

<screen>

</screen>

</para>

<para>
You now need to find the id of the project you wish to share the image with. 
This will generally be done by looking at the openrc file of that project and 
finding the <literal>OS_TENANT_ID</literal> variable (in this example, it is 
65bf648d-8d07-48af-8c3a-fa162a5b283f).
</para>

<para>
Using this tenant ID as an argument of the command line of 
<command>member-create</command>, the image 
(e0d35322-d509-4202-9b40-7d74e7aca0b6
in this example) can then be shared:

<screen>
glance  member-create e0d35322-d509-4202-9b40-7d74e7aca0b6 65bf648d-8d07-48af-8c3a-fa162a5b283f # share it
 
glance member-list --image-id e0d35322-d509-4202-9b40-7d74e7aca0b6 # check it is shared
</screen>

</para>

</section>

<section id="BuildingImages">
<title>Building Images</title>
<para>
Users can also build custom images, that can then been uploaded in
the Cloud Image service as described in 
<xref linkend="UserProvidedImages"/>.
</para>

<para>
There are several tools providing support for image creation. Some of them
are described in the <ulink url="http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/content/ch_creating_images_automatically.html">Openstack documentation</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
<literal>Oz</literal> is one of such tools that automates the process of 
creating a virtual machine image file.
Besides the <ulink url="https://github.com/clalancette/oz/wiki">official 
OZ documentation</ulink>, some notes (and examples) to build Scientific
Linux 6.x and CentOS 6.x
resizable images in QCOW2 format are available 
<ulink url="https://github.com/CloudPadovana/qcow2-resizable-images">here</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
The public SL6.x images of the CloudVeneto are built using OZ.
The relevant source files are available 
<ulink url="https://github.com/CloudPadovana/OZImages">here</ulink>.
</para>


<para>
A machine where Oz is installed is available to the users of the CloudVeneto.
To have access to this machine, please contact the 
administrators at <email>cedc-support@lists.pd.infn.it</email>.
Oz requires a configuration file that should be created as follows exchanging 
USERNAME for the login name of your user:

<screen>
$ cat ~/.oz/oz.cfg

[paths]
output_dir = /tmp/USERNAME/oz/images
data_dir = /tmp/USERNAME/oz/data
screenshot_dir = /tmp/USERNAME/oz/screenshot

[libvirt]
uri=qemu:///system

[cache]
original_media = yes
modified_media = no
jeos = no
</screen>
</para>
 
<para>
The directories specified in this configuration file must be manually created.
</para>


<section id="EnablingINFNPadovaLDAP">
<title>Enabling INFN Padova LDAP based authentication on the Virtual Machine</title>

<para>
When creating a custom image, it might be needed to enable a LDAP server
to manage authentication for users.

This section explains how to enable the INFN Padova's LDAP server for user 
authentication on the VMs of the Cloud.

To do that, the following LDAP client configurations, targeted to SL6.x 
systems, need to be available on the image used to start the VMs. 
</para>

<para>
First of all, the following packages must be installed:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>openssl</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>openldap</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>openldap-clients</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>pam-ldap</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>nss-pam-ldapd</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>nss-tools</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>nscd</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
Then the following files (included in this
<ulink url="https://wiki.infn.it/_media/progetti/cloud-areapd/user_s_guides/ldap.tar">ldap.tar</ulink>
tar file) must be 
installed on the Virtual Machine:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>/etc/openldap/cacerts/cacert.pem</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>/etc/openldap/ldap.conf</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>/etc/pam_ldap.conf</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>/etc/nsswitch.conf</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>/etc/nslcd.conf</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>/etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>/etc/pam.d/password-auth-ac</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</para>
<para>

To do that, it is enough to log on the VM and:

<screen>
cd /
tar xvf / path/ldap.tar
</screen>

</para>

<para>
Then it is necessary to start the nslcd and nscd services:

<screen>
service nslcd start
service nscd start
chkconfig nslcd on
chkconfig nscd on
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Then it is just necessary to “enable” the relevant accounts on the VM adding 
in the /etc/passwd file:

<screen>
+name1::::::
+name2::::::
...
</screen>
and creating their home directories.
</para>

<para>
Changes done in /etc/passwd could not be applied immediately by the system. 
In this case a:

<screen>
nscd -i passwd
should help.
</screen>

</para>

<note><para>
Please note that the images <literal>SL6x-Padova-x86-64-&lt;date&gt;</literal>
have already the LDAP client 
properly configured to use the Padova LDAP server. 
Using these images it is just necessary to enable the 
relevant users in /etc/passwd and create their home directories.
</para></note>
