<title>Managing Images</title>
<para>
In a cloud environment, Virtual Machines are instantiated from images. These 
images are registered in an Image Management Service, in our case provided by 
the Glance OpenStack component. 
</para>

<section id="PublicImages">
<title>Public Images</title>
<para>
Some images in the CloudVeneto are provided by the Cloud 
administrators. These images are public, and visible to all users.
They appear in the <menuchoice><guimenu>Public</guimenu></menuchoice> 
tab of the <menuchoice><guimenu>Images</guimenu></menuchoice> 
menu.

<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
  <imagedata condition="web" fileref="./images/public_images.png"/>
  <imagedata condition="pdf" fileref="./images/public_images.png" width="450" />
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>

</para>

<para>
In the CloudVeneto cloud images are provided in QCOW2 format.
They are fully resizable also with respect to the disk size.
</para>


</section>

<section id="UserProvidedImages">
<title>User Provided Images</title>
<para>
Along with the standard images, users can provide their own images
and upload them to the Cloud Image service:
these images are private, meaning that they are only available to the users 
of the project they are uploaded for.
</para>

<note><para>
Users are not allowed to publish public (i.e. available to all projects) 
images.
This means you cannot use the <literal>--public</literal> flag
with the <literal> glance image-create</literal> command, otherwise you will 
get a quite cryptic error message such as:

<screen>
Request returned failure status.
403 Forbidden
Access was denied to this resource.
    (HTTP 403)
</screen>
</para></note>


<para>
Many open source projects such as Ubuntu and Fedora now produce pre-built 
images which can be used for certain clouds. If these are available, it is 
much easier to use them compared to building your own.

<itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para><ulink url="https://getfedora.org/cloud/">Fedora repository</ulink></para></listitem> 
   <listitem><para><ulink url="https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu repository</ulink></para></listitem> 
</itemizedlist>

</para>

<para>
Using an Ubuntu image as an example, after you downloaded the
image from the relevant web site, to upload such image 
using the command line tools you need to:

<itemizedlist>
   <listitem><para>Authenticate to OpenStack using the openrc source:
      <screen>
$ . demo-openrc.sh
      </screen>
   </para></listitem>
   <listitem><para>Issue th following command:
      <screen>
$ glance image-create --name=ubuntu-trusty --disk-format=qcow2 \
      --container-format=bare --property hypervisor_type=qemu \
      --file trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-disk1.img
      </screen>
   </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

Once loaded, the image can then be used to create virtual machines. 
</para>

<para>
Some system software is delivered in ISO image format. 
For example, these steps show how to create an image from the Freedos ISO 
available from <ulink url="http://www.freedos.org/download/download/fd11src.iso">here</ulink>

<screen>
$ glance image-create --name freedos11 --disk-format=iso \
--container-format=bare --file=fd11src.iso
</screen>
</para>


<note><para>
In the CloudVeneto cloud image size is limited to 25 GB.
</para></note>


<warning><para>
No backup is currently done on user provided images or snapshots.
Therefore users with private images should keep a copy of the images they 
have uploaded in their private archives. 
</para></warning>

<section id="SharingImages">
<title>Sharing Images</title>
<para>
As mentioned before, users are not allowed to publish public images.
However images can be shared between different projects. This is currently only
possible via the command line tools.
</para>

<para>
If an image has been uploaded to your currently active project, using the
procedure described in 
<xref linkend="UserProvidedImages"/>, 
you can then use the <command>glance member-create</command> operations to 
share that image with another project.
</para>

<para>
To share an image, first source the project profile for the 
project containing the image you want to share and find its id with
the <command>glance image-show</command> command
(e0d35322-d509-4202-9b40-7d74e7aca0b6 in the 
example):

<screen>
$ glance image-show ubuntu-trusty

</screen>

</para>

<para>
You now need to find the id of the project you wish to share the image with. 
This will generally be done by looking at the openrc file of that project and 
finding the <literal>OS_TENANT_ID</literal> variable (in this example, it is 
65bf648d-8d07-48af-8c3a-fa162a5b283f).
</para>

<para>
Using this tenant ID as an argument of the command line of 
<command>member-create</command>, the image 
(e0d35322-d509-4202-9b40-7d74e7aca0b6
in this example) can then be shared:

<screen>
glance  member-create e0d35322-d509-4202-9b40-7d74e7aca0b6 65bf648d-8d07-48af-8c3a-fa162a5b283f # share it
 
glance member-list --image-id e0d35322-d509-4202-9b40-7d74e7aca0b6 # check it is shared
</screen>

</para>

<section id="DeletingImages">
<title>Deleting Images</title>

<para>Images that are not used anymore can be deleted. Deletion of images is permanent and cannot be reversed.</para>

<para>
To delete an image, log in to the dashboard and select the appropriate project from the drop down menu at the top left.
On the <menuchoice><guimenu>Compute</guimenu><guisubmenu>Images</guisubmenu></menuchoice> page select the images you want to delete
and click <menuchoice><guimenu>Delete Images</guimenu></menuchoice>. 
Confirm your action pressing the <menuchoice><guimenu>Delete Images</guimenu></menuchoice> again on the confirmation dialog box.
</para>

<warning><para>
Don't delete an image if are there are virtual machines created using this image, otherwise these VMs won't be able to start if hard rebooted.
</para></warning>
